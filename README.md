# Database-Group-Assignment

This repository contains our codes used to create the tables and query them.
We are excited to allow you into our codes and get to experience it with us.

In this project, we step into the role of a database administrator tasked with building a MySQL database to store and manage data for a BookStore. By applying our skills in database design, table creation, data loading, and user management, we develop an organized system for this important real-world system.
This hands-on project provides valuable experience in efficiently structuring databases to handle large, complex data.

Project Objective
The project goal is to build a relational database that stores information about the bookstore's operations, including books, authors, customers, orders, shipping, and more.

Expected Outcomes
By completing this SQL project, we gain practical experience and valuable, transferable skills, including:
Designing and implementing a MySQL database for a real-world use case
Creating tables with the optimal schema and data types for the dataset
Managing database access through user groups and roles to ensure security
Querying the data to extract meaningful insights
